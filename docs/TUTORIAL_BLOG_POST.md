## Introduction

Large language models are impressive, but they're generalists. Ask GPT-4 about condensed matter physics, and you'll get a decent answer—but ask it about the specifics of BCS theory or the subtleties of topological insulators, and you'll quickly see the limits of general knowledge.

What if you could create an LLM that's an **expert** in your domain? Not just fine-tuned on generic text, but truly specialized with deep knowledge from research papers, textbooks, and domain-specific literature?

In this tutorial, I'll show you how to build a domain-expert LLM for condensed matter physics in under 10 minutes using **CondensAI**—an open-source toolkit that combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA).

**What you'll build:** A physics expert that can answer questions about superconductivity, topology, and correlated electron systems with proper citations to primary literature.

## Why Domain-Specialized LLMs?

General LLMs have three key limitations for scientific domains:

1. **Breadth over depth**: They know a little about everything but lack deep expertise
2. **No citations**: They can't point you to the original papers
3. **Stale knowledge**: Training data cutoffs mean they miss recent research

Domain-specialized LLMs solve this by:
- Training on **primary sources** (papers, textbooks, reviews)
- Using **retrieval augmentation** to ground answers in real literature
- Providing **citations** so you can verify claims

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Basic familiarity with command line
- A GPU helps but isn't required (we'll use a small model for demo)

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install condensai
```

That's it—CondensAI handles the complexity of transformers, PEFT, and FAISS under the hood.

## Step 1: Prepare Your Domain Data

First, gather your domain knowledge. For condensed matter physics, we organize by subfield:

```
data/
├── raw/
│   ├── superconductivity/
│   │   ├── BCS_1957.txt
│   │   ├── Tinkham_ch3.txt
│   │   └── Bednorz_Muller_1986.txt
│   ├── topology/
│   │   ├── TKNN_1982.txt
│   │   └── Kane_Mele_2005.txt
│   └── correlated/
│       ├── Mott_insulators.txt
│       └── Hubbard_model.txt
```

Each file contains excerpts from real papers or textbooks. Here's an example from `BCS_1957.txt`:

```
Bardeen, J., Cooper, L. N., & Schrieffer, J. R. (1957). 
"Theory of Superconductivity." Physical Review, 108(5), 1175.

Key insight: The interaction between electrons via phonon exchange 
can overcome Coulomb repulsion, leading to bound Cooper pairs...
```

**Pro tip**: Include DOI links and proper citations. This becomes your retrieval corpus.

## Step 2: Configure Your Expert

Create a YAML config file (`configs/condensed_matter.yaml`):

```yaml
model:
  base: meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf
  lora_r: 16
  lora_alpha: 32
  quantization: 4bit

retrieval:
  chunks: 512
  overlap: 50
  top_k: 5
  use_cross_encoder: true

training:
  epochs: 3
  batch_size: 4
  learning_rate: 2e-4
```

This config tells CondensAI to:
- Use Llama-2-7B as the base model
- Apply LoRA with r=16 for efficient fine-tuning
- Quantize to 4-bit for memory efficiency
- Retrieve top 5 relevant chunks with cross-encoder reranking

## Step 3: Train Your Expert

With your data and config ready, training is a single command:

```python
from condensai import train

train(config_path="configs/condensed_matter.yaml")
```

For a 7B model with LoRA, this takes ~2 hours on a single GPU. The output is a lightweight adapter (<50MB) that specializes the base model for condensed matter physics.

**What's happening under the hood:**
1. **Chunking**: Your documents are split into overlapping chunks
2. **Embedding**: Each chunk is embedded with sentence-transformers
3. **Indexing**: FAISS builds a similarity index for fast retrieval
4. **Fine-tuning**: LoRA adapts the LLM to physics terminology and reasoning

## Step 4: Query Your Expert

Now for the fun part—asking questions:

```python
from condensai import CondensAIExpert

expert = CondensAIExpert(
    config_path="configs/condensed_matter.yaml",
    adapter_path="outputs/condensed_matter_adapter/"
)

question = "What is the mechanism behind Cooper pair formation?"
answer = expert.answer(question)

print(answer.text)
print("\nCitations:")
for citation in answer.citations:
    print(f"- {citation}")
```

**Example output:**

```
Cooper pair formation occurs through phonon-mediated attraction 
between electrons near the Fermi surface. When an electron moves 
through the crystal lattice, it creates a local distortion that 
attracts another electron, overcoming Coulomb repulsion.

Key points:
- Phonon exchange creates effective attraction (Eliashberg theory)
- Pairs form with opposite momentum and spin (k↑, -k↓)
- Binding energy is ~meV scale (much smaller than eV Fermi energy)
- Results in macroscopic quantum coherence (BCS ground state)

Citations:
- Bardeen, J., Cooper, L. N., & Schrieffer, J. R. (1957). 
  Physical Review, 108(5), 1175.
- Tinkham, M. (2004). Introduction to Superconductivity, Ch. 3.
- Scalapino, D. J. (1969). In Superconductivity (pp. 449-513).
```

Notice the **citations**—you can verify every claim against primary sources.

## Step 5: Deploy and Share

CondensAI includes a Streamlit UI for non-technical users:

```bash
streamlit run examples/05_streamlit_ui.py
```

This launches a chat interface where users can:
- Ask physics questions
- See confidence scores
- View citations with links to papers
- Toggle between different subdomains

For production deployment, CondensAI supports:
- **vLLM** for high-throughput serving
- **Docker** containers
- **FastAPI** endpoints with OpenAI-compatible API

## Why This Matters

Domain-specialized LLMs aren't just about better answers—they're about **trustworthy** answers. In science, you need to:

1. **Verify claims** against original sources
2. **Understand limitations** (confidence scores help)
3. **Explore further** (citations point you to more reading)

CondensAI makes this accessible without requiring a team of ML engineers.
